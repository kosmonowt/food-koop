# FoodKoop
Web Application to manage small communities of (organic) food consumer's cooperation. Based on Laravel &amp; CanJS.

## Preface
Since this software will be developed primary for a German asociation we will keep discussions (at first) in German.
Code though will be commented in English, eventually.
It is not thought to give support to this piece of software, although everyone is free to contribute.
This might be a very specialized WebApplication, so until it will be finished (when it's done) we will follow the specifications of biokiste.org

## Technologies
It is thought to use 
* Laravel for the backend and HTML generation.
* CanJS for the client-side frontend.
* Bootstrap is used as CSS-Framework

## Features / Aims of the App

### Member Management

* *Members* are groups of individuals (*Users*) that live physically at the same address.
* Members are organized in *MemberGroups* (i.E. administration or service groups for different community tasks)
* Members can have *MemberStates*, which can define a classification of fees to pay.
* Members are subject to fees, such as a quarter-year-fee or an initial admission or credit to the FoodKoop. Those will be noted in the *MemberLedger* (Mitgliedskonto)
* Members can sign up to service tasks in a *Roster* (Dienstplan). The tasks that should be done should result from their *MemberGroup*
* Fullfillment of the member's duties as well as the ledger should be easily monitored.

### Order Management

* Members can do *Orders* to suit their needs of consumption.
* Orders are made off a *Product*-catalogue, that holds products of different *Merchants* (Anbieter).
* Orders can have OrderStates
